DESCRIPTION

This is some of my early demos that were written during the first years of my
university studies.

Initially they were written using TASM syntax, but now I have adapted them to
compile with FASM (http://flatassembler.net).

* plasma     512 byte demo showing a simple plasma effect;

* clouds     512 byte demo was written for the MindResources2001 demoparty. 
             It shows something resembling running clouds.

* magtro     intro writing for Mortal Antibiotic Group. It contains a (stupid) 
             algorithm to convert the internal bitmap font to a vector format.

* fract_wi   4kb intro showing some fractal effects on the theme of winter.
